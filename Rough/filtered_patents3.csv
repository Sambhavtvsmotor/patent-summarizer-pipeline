The system / method incorporates one or more surge suppres sion devices ( SSDs ) proximally located and in parallel with a capacitor structure to produce an overall protected capaci tor structure having enhanced reliability and simultaneous ability to resist transient overvoltage conditions . The SSDs are formed from series combinations of transient voltage surge suppressors ( TVSs ) ( metal oxide varistor ( MOV ) , diode for alternating current ( DIAC ) , and / or silicon diode for alternating current ( SIDAC ) ) and corresponding shunt diode rectifiers ( SDRs ) and placed in parallel across a capacitor structure to locally suppress voltage transients across the capacitor structure in excess of the voltage rating of the capacitor structure . The parallel shunting TVS / SDR pairs may be integrated into a printed circuit board ( PCB ) assembly that is externally attached to the capacitor structure or encapsulated in an enclosure incorporating the capacitor structure . 20 Claims , 64 Drawing Sheets ( 51 ) Int .
