In an embodiment, the internal combustion engine (100) includes a crankcase (110, 118) housing a crankshaft (112, 120) of the internal combustion engine (100). The crankcase (110, 118) includes at least a first crankcase chamber (302) forming a passage for exit of air-lubricant mixture from the crankcase (110, 118). The internal combustion engine (100) further includes a breather cover (202) detachably attached to the crankcase (110, 118). The breather cover (202) has at least a first breather chamber (308) in fluid connection with the first crankcase chamber (302) in the crankcase (110, 118). The first breather chamber (308) receives the air-lubricant mixture from the first crankcase chamber (302). Further, according to an aspect of the present subject matter, a size of the first crankcase chamber (302) is substantially greater than a size of the first breather chamber (308)."}
