Generally the sensor element (27) is mounted in an intake manifold (32) of the internal combustion engine (25). However the intake manifold faces a space constraint and also radiates unwanted heat which is not suitable for the sensing element (27). Thus, the sensing element (27) is to be mounted on the mainframe assembly (102). The MAP sensor (27) is mounted on the mainframe assembly (102) to provide it a stable and rigid mounting free form vibrations, and also protect it from the heat which is radiated from an internal combustion engine (25) or its intake manifold (32)."}
